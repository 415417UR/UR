<b>Final Project: IOT LPG GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION</b>
LPG gas is the most commonly used Domestic fuel in every household. LPG
(Liquefied petroleum gas). It is very sensitive to fire and can cause a great disaster if
it's exposed to any fire source without precaution. Many of the domestic accidents
occur due to the leakage of LPG gas. So, as the safety plays an important role this
IOT project is also designed for detection of LPG gas leakage. <br><br>
<b>Info:</b>
The gas sensor is used to identify the smell of gas leakage. LCD is turned on, when
the gas gets leaked. If gas leakage takes place, both the LCD and GSM modem will
be turned ON. With the help of GSM modem, messages notifying gas leakage will be
send as SMS to user.
